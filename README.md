# ProgressCLI95

Progressbar95 but in a terminal. What else did you expect? Made by BurningInfern0. 

*Progress on in your command line interface!*

Update 7/25/22: This project is not likely to get any more updates in the future and therefore development will stop indefinitely, to which the repo will be archived. I have other projects that require my attention.

## Build Versions
- Current Stable Version: `0.2.2a`
  - Stable builds are builds that are confirmed to work perfectly with the littlest amount of bugs, designed for public use.
    - Stable builds are available on the releases tab.
- Current Development Version: `0.2.2b-dev2`
  - Development builds are versions that might be a bit more buggy than stable, but provide more features.
    - Dev builds are available on on the releases tab.
- Current Rolling Version: `0.2.3-rolling1`
  - Rolling release builds are versions that might contain major bugs, and could do some possible damage to your save or settings file. Make sure not to launch the game on your main save, and use this only for playtesting the latest features, and reporting bugs that we missed.
    - Rolling builds are offered not via the releases tab, but by downloading the main branch code.

## Common Issues
Before you create an issue, please make sure you check the following:
- Please check that the dependencies are installed.
- Did you get an error about pip not being found when you ran `pip install rich`?
  - **Windows:** That means that pip is not installed in your PATH variable. Simply run `python -m pip install rich` to go around this issue.
  - **Linux:** This means that the pip package is not installed. Run your package manager with the package `python-pip` and install `rich` after.
- Did you get an error about Python not being found when you launched `boot.py`?
  - **Windows:** Python is either not installed, or you did not check the box in the installer to put Python into PATH.
  - **Linux:** Make sure Python is installed and can be found within a folder in your $PATH variable.
- Did you run the game in Python 2 or Python 3?
  - _If you ran the game in Python 2, please run the game in Python 3._
- Did you run the game _inside_ of the extracted contents?
- Has someone already made an issue about it?
